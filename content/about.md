I'm jcjordyn120 and this is my blog.  
I'm known all around the internet under various versions of jcjordyn1*0.    
I'm a computer enthusiast and like to code in golang and python 3, I experiment with different languages every now and again.    
I'm mostly known for my small pet projects, hating systemd and DRM, so I tend to not use systemd and rip my blurays/netflix streams.    

Oh and I tend to use this image as my avatar:

### Systems
#### This Server (Upgraded prebuilt)
#### About
I got this system as my primary desktop a year or so ago, back then I was using a raspberry pi as my server.    
It worked great, but it got little use because I was always going places or doing other things, so I decided to start using it to help the pi as I kept it on all the time anyways.    
After a (very short) while I ran out of space on that single 500GB hard drive (besides I should have used RAID anyways), so I saved up some money and bought 3 4TB hard drives and migrated fully to the current server.

#### Stats
3 4TB HDDs in RAIDZ1 for mass data using ZFS  
2 120GB SSDs in a mirror for root, using ZFS again.  
24GB of DDR4 RAM  
an nVidia GTX 960 passed to a VM for gaming, the host uses the integrated graphics.  
an Intel i5-6402P CPU, and yes this has meltdown and spectre but it's patched.  
Gentoo Linux for the distro, using runit and libressl as always.  
a H170-PRO motherboard.  
a NZXT phantom case.  
a 500w power supply. (I'm suprised this thing can handle all this stuff)    
Last but not least: a 30/10 VDSL2 internet connection provided by AT&T, the desktop is connected over gigabit powerline though.  

#### My Laptop (HP Envy x360 m6)

#### About
I got this after getting the server because I needed something portable and more usable than a phone or tablet.

#### Stats
1 1TB HDD (It has an M.2 slot but I can't afford one).    
12GB of DDR4 RAM.    
an Intel HD Graphics 620 for graphics (this can run GTA 4 well enough suprisingly).    
an Intel i5-7200U CPU.     
A dualboot between Void Linux and Windows 10.    
A 10-point touchscreen.    
A backlit with numpad QWERTY keyboard.    
It has no optical drive or ethernet, but I rarely use those anyways.
