I'm jcjordyn120 and this is my blog.  
I'm a computer enthusiast and like to code in golang and python 3.   

### Server details
This server used to be hosted on a raspberry pi 3 with an external usb HDD.

Now it's hosted on my desktop which contains:  
3 4TB HDDs in RAIDZ1 for mass data using ZFS  
2 120GB SSDs in a mirror for root, using ZFS again.  
24GB of DDR4 RAM  
an nVidia GTX 960 passed to a VM for gaming, the host uses the integrated graphics.  
an Intel(R) i5-6402P CPU, and yes this has meltdown and spectre but it's patched.  
Gentoo Linux for the distro, using runit and libressl as always.  
a H170-PRO motherboard.  
a NZXT phantom case.  
Last but not least: a 30/10 VDSL2 internet connection provided by AT&T, the desktop is connected over gigabit powerline though.  

And the pi? As you're reading this it's either a (data) backup server or a tablet.
