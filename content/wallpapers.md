Here you will find all my wallapers.

You can get them using the following [torrent file](/Wallpapers_07-15-2018.torrent) in 4K, with the source (needs GIMP and blender to render).

### Blissful Sky
This is my first wallpaper, Blissful sky.    
I made it to look like the popular bliss (from windows XP).

### Waves
This is waves (original name, huh?), I made it from my memory of the homebrew channel (from the wii).

### Tiles
This is tiles, I made it after I saw something that could be improved on google plus.
Sadly I can't remember who I got this from or I'd give credit.

This is the same thing, but with my favorite Linux distro's logo in the middle.
